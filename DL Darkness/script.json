Default = 0\r      //reduce the radius of the darkness by this many pixels.\r      allows the source of the darkness to be seen at the outer border of the darkness.\r-   **'makeGrid'** < true/false > //Optional. Default = true\r      draw a grid inside of the darkness circle.\r      the grid will be aligned with the map grid based on page settings\r- **'SendToMapLayer'** < true/false > //Optional. Default = true\r      send the source token to the map layer after creating the DL path?\r      if true, will send to map layer and perform a z-order 'ToFront'\r      if false, will keep on token layer and perform a z-order 'ToBack'\r\r**Example Syntax**\r`!dldark`\r`!dldark 15 true`\r`!dldark ?{buffer radius?|15} true false`",
